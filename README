A cross-platform gamepad library.

This library is intended for another project (closed-source, sorry) which may
require cross-platform gamepad support. Only necessary features are implemented,
i.e.

 - Disambiguating different gamepads.

 - Hotplugging support, with guarentee that the gamepad will not be mixed when
   such event happens.
   
 - Handling axis and button events.

 - Uses BSD or more flexible license.
