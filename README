A cross-platform gamepad library.

This library is intended for another project (closed-source, sorry) which may
require cross-platform gamepad support. Only necessary features are implemented,
i.e.

 - Disambiguating different gamepads.

 - Hotplugging support, with guarentee that the gamepad will not be mixed when
   such event happens.
   
 - Handling axis and button events.

 - Uses BSD or more flexible license.

The library current has the following limitations:

 - Only buttons from the Button usage page (09) are supported
 - Only up to 13 specific axes from the Generic Desktop usage page (01) are sup-
   ported per gamepad. They are:
    * X (31), Y (32), Z (33), Rx (34), Ry (35), Rz (36),
    * Vx (41), Vy (42), Vz (43), Vbrx (44), Vbry (45), Vbrz (46), Vno (47)
 - Axes must be in linear scale.
 - The default position of each axis should be in ceil((min+max)/2), otherwise
   you may observe drifting.
 - Calibration is ignored.
 - On Windows, axes must not be specified as a usage array.
